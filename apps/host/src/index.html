	<title>Case Study of ToDo apps using various frameworks</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>This is the beginning of a framework exploration</h1>
  <h2>React vs Angular vs Vue vs Qwik vs everyone</h2>
  <p>
    In this case study I will develop a small ToDo app over and over using various frameworks.
    I try to make the app challenging so that most of the features of a frameworks can be used.
    The focus is on developing this application, without any additional libraries. 
  </p>

  <h2>Then I compare</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Mental Model</b> - What general thinking is required in order to understand the framework?</li>
    <li><b>Structure/Flexibility</b> - How opinionated and configurable is the framework?   </li>
    <li><b>State Management</b> - How does the application share a state?</li>
    <li><b>Features Out of Box</b> - How much can be done without external libraries?</li>
    <li><b>Performance<b> - How big is the Bundle? How good will it perform during runtime?</li>
    <li><b>Ease of Use</b> - How is the learning curve from starter to master? (Biased towards React)</li>
    <li><b>Level of Magic</b> - How easy is it to understand what is going on?</li>
    <li><b>Caveats</b> - General things need to be aware of and other concerns!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What will not be compared</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Server Side Rendering</li>
    <li><b>Build Tools</b> - There are too many alternatives</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>App Implementation</h2>
