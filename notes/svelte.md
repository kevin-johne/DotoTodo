# Svelte

Svelte made a big leap forward compared to react, vue angular. It compiles the code and serves specific js css and html based on the code.

Updates are not made by diffing shadow dom but instead are made surgically when the app state updates. Is it similar to jQuery, by finding the node and make updates.
