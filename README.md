# Doto Todo

The app is a to do list with a drag and drop support. With features like creating tickets, rearranging order to show priority, and marking as done.

A personal project to compare current frameworks. The aim is to write the same app in using diffrent tools. Preview on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/kevin-johne/DotoTodo/main?file=%2FREADME.md&workspace=%257B%2522activeFileId%2522%253A%2522clevc8uz20000g9iug4rt8u4y%2522%252C%2522openFiles%2522%253A%255B%2522%252FREADME.md%2522%252C%2522%252Fsrc%252FCard.jsx%2522%255D%252C%2522sidebarPanel%2522%253A%2522EXPLORER%2522%252C%2522gitSidebarPanel%2522%253A%2522COMMIT%2522%252C%2522spaces%2522%253A%257B%2522clevc0drs00152a6ezive43ef%2522%253A%257B%2522key%2522%253A%2522clevc0drs00152a6ezive43ef%2522%252C%2522name%2522%253A%2522Default%2522%252C%2522devtools%2522%253A%255B%255D%257D%257D%252C%2522currentSpace%2522%253A%2522clevc0drs00152a6ezive43ef%2522%252C%2522spacesOrder%2522%253A%255B%2522clevc0drs00152a6ezive43ef%2522%255D%252C%2522hideCodeEditor%2522%253Atrue%257D)

First I will write the app in react (for a refresher) and try not using any other tools so this can be compared equally later one.
I hope to cover the following frontend rendering frameworks:

- [ ] Alpine
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Enhance
- [ ] Qwik
- [ ] React (in progress)
- [ ] Solid
- [ ] Svelte
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Vue

Some questions I will ask myself when comparing the implementation of the same solution in different libraries.
*Buisness problems:*
- How is the performance from an SEO point of view.
- How is the performance from a User point of view.

*Technical problems:*
- How well does it fit with styling isolated components.
- How well does it do media queries.
- How well does it do animations.
- Are most of the common problems already solved in that ecosystem?
- What options are there for styling.
- How can the app be tested.

*Dev Experience:*
- How easy is it to write code aka, how hard is the lurning curve.
- How easy is it to read code.
- How are the learning resources.
- Does it come with a CLI to boost bootstrapping.
