# Doto Todo

The app is a to do list with a drag and drop support. With features like creating tickets, rearranging order to show priority, and marking as done.

A personal project to compare current frameworks. The aim is to write the same app in using diffrent tools. Preview on [Netlify](https://main--beamish-babka-3a36c6.netlify.app/)

First I will write the app in react (for a refresher) and try not using any other tools so this can be compared equally later one.
I hope to cover the following frontend rendering frameworks:

- [ ] Alpine
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Enhance
- [ ] Qwik
- [ ] React (in progress)
- [ ] Solid
- [ ] Svelte
- [ ] Vercel
- [ ] Vue

Some questions I will ask myself when comparing the implementation of the same solution in different libraries.
*Buisness problems:*
- How is the performance from an SEO point of view.
- How is the performance from a User point of view.

*Technical problems:*
- How well does it fit with styling isolated components.
- How well does it do media queries.
- How well does it do animations.
- Are most of the common problems already solved in that ecosystem?
- What options are there for styling.
- How can the app be tested.

*Dev Experience:*
- How easy is it to write code aka, how hard is the lurning curve.
- How easy is it to read code.
- How are the learning resources.
- Does it come with a CLI to boost bootstrapping.
